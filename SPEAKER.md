Andreas Kling Guest Lecture
===========================

Well, hello friends! On April 9 [Andreas
Kling](https://twitter.com/awesomekling) will give a guest lecture in
CS 4560 Web Browser Internals. Andreas will be joining over Zoom to
talk about web browser engineering, including a short demonstration
and time for Q&A.

**Location**: BEH S 114
**Time**: April 9 at 9:00am MDT

Andreas Kling is the founder and current lead developer on the
[Ladybird](https://ladybird.dev/) browser engine, part of the larger
[SerenityOS](https://serenityos.org/) project. As part of this,
Andreas has worked on almost all parts of the browser engine and all
of its supporting libraries.

He got his start contributing to the [KDE Project](https://kde.org/)
and its [Konqueror](https://apps.kde.org/konqueror/) browser, later
forked by Apple when creating WebKit.

His first browser job was at Nokia, working on WebKit browsers for
Nokia phones, and he later moved to Apple to work on Safari for macOS
and iOS.

After leaving Apple and confronting a lifelong problem with addiction
in 2018, he started the SerenityOS project and later also the Ladybird
project.

Ladybird is a completely new browser intended to one day support the
full web platform and be usable for day-to-day browsing. It is largely
developed by a team of volunteers, though in the last few months a
couple of them have been hired as full-time engineers.

To date, it boasts substantial compliance with many web standards and
is usable for many browsing tasks. It is also rapidly growing in
capabilities and correctness.

Besides contributing code to Ladybird and SerenityOS, he also is an
active [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/c/andreaskling), sharing
his development process and inviting viewers to follow along with him
as he works on web browser engines, operating system kernels, and
compilers.
